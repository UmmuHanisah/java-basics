// A: No, because interface fields are static and final by default 
// and you canâ€™t change their value once they are initialized. 
// In the above code, methodB() is changing value of interface field A.i. 
// It shows compile time error.
interface Ant {
    int i = 100;
}

class Buffalo implements Ant {

    void methodB() {
//        i = 222; Cannot assign value to a final variable i
    }
